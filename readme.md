# Undergrad Work
This is a conglomeration of all of the repos that I had posted on Github
previously. For the most part is just code, I tried to include as much other
documentation as possible but some of it was lost in a hard drive failure.

Some of these classes are basically empty, I know, I wish the code was there
too.

## Tutoring
If you are really looking for help then I highly recommend using the free
resources provided by Auburn. If you do want 1on1 help that is not another
student then email Mr. Lovelace, he has a list of people who have volunteered
to tutor students in some subjects/languages.
