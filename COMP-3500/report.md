## Solution Description
1. Both are written in my simulation class.
2. See simulator.cpp
3. turnaround - burst times
4. start - arrival times
5. finish - arrival times
6. See main.cpp
## Generality and Error Checking
1. General enough that you could enter in any list file that is formatted properly can be run.
2. It would depend on the policy.
3. Somewhat
## Misc Factors
1. As elegant as I could make it.
2. I made flow diagrams of how I think it should work and then coded from that.
3. I didnt use any outside sources other than cplusplus.com, so yes.
