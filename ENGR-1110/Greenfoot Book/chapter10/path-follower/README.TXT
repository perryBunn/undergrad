A simple example showing an actor follow a line on the ground.

The line is just painted on the background. The actor (here: a Greep)
is looking for a certain colour - in this example a brownish colour.

This is done by using two eyes: The Greep checks the background at
the position of each of its eyes, and turns if it sees grass with 
one eye (turn left, if right eye sees grass; and vice versa).

This is the starting scenario for an exercise - it in incomplete.
